# **Naval War Simulation Game** 

>“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” --- Sun Tzu

## 1. Introduction

Have you ever wondered what it is like to demolish your long-time enemy on a naval battle? Have you ever wanted to reveal your secret strength as a mediaval marine strategist? Well, this game is for you! Summon your crews, procure your ammunitions, and go on an adventure of naval war simulation with Captain Angelina and K!

## 2. Description

For this final project of OIM3640, we are going to create a battle ship game for 2 players. On a coordinate system of n x n matrix, players are going to be able place customazed number of ships on the coordinate. There are various sizes for ships, 3 coordinate size being the largest and all the way to 1 coordinate size being the smallest ship. The number of ships which players can place is disproportionate to the size of ships (i.e. 3 sized ships will have the smallest number of ships and 1 sized ships will have the highest number of ships.) The players will take turn to bombard one coordinate per turn, and players will get an extra turn if they manage to hit a coordinate in which a part of a ship lies.
